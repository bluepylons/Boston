This is a prototype case that reduces the front height ~2.2mm, switches to countersunk screws for the screws holding the plate, and provides a visually nicer transition between the Right-key-separator and the rest of the case near the arrow keys. The Left-key-separator is unchanged from the current 3D-printed design.
