This is a prototype 3D-printed case with the following improvements:
* Reduces front height by ~2mm
* Reduces width by ~2mm
* Switches to countersunk screws for the top screws so that they no logner protrude
* Changes side profile a bit so that the top and bottom bezels are more even
* Revised Right-key separator so that it transitions better into Right-half near the arrow keys

This is intended to be backwards compatible with existing 3DP Bostons. The far right and far left bottom screws switch to shorter M3x8 screws. 

This is still being prototyped and tested.
