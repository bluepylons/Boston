This is a prototype case that reduces the front height by ~2mm, switches to countersunk screws for the top screws so that they no longer protrude, changes the side profile a bit so that the top and bottom bezels are more even, and revised Right-key-separator so that it transitions better into Right-half near the arrow keys. This works with existing PCBs, plates, and panels; only the 3D-printed bits are to be replaced, along with the far left and far right bottom screws (which should use shorter M3x8 screws). Left-key-separator is unchanged from the current 3D-printed design.

This is still being prototyped and tested.
